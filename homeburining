      "newsdata": "A giant tabular iceberg named A68A, which was adrift in the South Atlantic was calved from Antarctica's Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017 and reportedly by April 2021, it vanished. \r\n\r\nNow a new report sheds light upon the melting speed of the giant iceberg as it has been revealed that it was dumping more than 152 billion tonnes of fresh water into the ocean every single day when the melting was at its peak. \n\nThe latest developments emerged after the researchers from the University of Leeds said that fresh water was released when the iceberg scraped past the island of South Georgia in 2021. \r\n\r\nAs per the study, 152 billion tonnes of water is equivalent to 20 times the amount of water in Loch Ness or 61 million Olympic sized swimming pools.\n\nA68A gained attention in December 2020 when it drifted worryingly close to South Georgia. It had raised concerns it could harm the island's ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSatellite measurements were used to chart the A68A iceberg's area and thickness change throughout its life cycle. The researchers from the University of Leeds, Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) and British Antarctic Survey (BAS) mapped the changes. \r\n\r\nAnne Braakmann-Folgmann, a researcher at CPOM and PhD candidate at the University of Leeds' School of Earth and Environment, is lead author of the study. \r\n\r\nShe said: \"This is a huge amount of melt water, and the next thing we want to learn is whether it had a positive or negative impact on the ecosystem around South Georgia.\"\n\n\"Because A68A took a common route across the Drake Passage, we hope to learn more about icebergs taking a similar trajectory, and how they influence the polar oceans,\" she added. \r\n\r\nA68A covered an area of nearly 6,000 sq km when it was separated from Antarctica in 2017 and for s short period of time, it was the world's biggest iceberg, as aerial videos and images captured the 'mega iceberg' also highlighting the impact of global warming. \r\n\r\nThe largest iceberg was B-15 which measured 11,000 sq km before breaking up. Scientific reports stated that the calving of A68A reduced the overall size of the Larsen C shelf by 12 per cent. \n\nLast Updated 21 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "After months of speculation and reports, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has concluded that US diplomats suffering what has been dubbed 'Havana Syndrome' were not targeted by a foreign power.\r\n\r\nHere's a look at what the mystery was, and what the CIA concluded, according to reports.\r\n\r\nWhat is 'Havana Syndrome'?\r\n\r\nThe mysterious condition came to public attention in 2016 after dozens of diplomats at the American embassy in Havana, Cuba, started complaining of sickness. Their symptoms included migraines, nausea, memory lapses and dizziness. Some of the people who experienced it were left with symptoms for months. The latest cases include one person who had to be evacuate from Switzerland to the US for treatment.\r\n\r\nHow many 'cases' were reported and investigated?\r\n\r\nOver the past five year, thousands of alleged cases of the mystery condition have been reported by diplomats, spies and US officials across a wide variety of geographies including in Vienna, Paris, Geneva, Beijing, and Havana, among others.\n\nAccording to a report in the New York Times, 1,000 cases reviewed by US investigators were explainable. A CIA report concluded that these cases can be explained by environmental causes, undiagnosed medical conditions or stress, rather than actions by a foreign power.\r\n\r\nThe report further said that two dozen cases remain unexplained.\r\n\r\nCase also reported in India?\r\n\r\nIn September 2021, a member of CIA director Bill Burns' delegation reported symptoms consistent with the 'Havana Syndrome' and had to receive medical attention.\r\n\r\nWhat was originally suspected?\r\n\r\nUS officials have previously alleged the cases could have been caused by Russian microwave attacks, but scientists expressed doubts about the theory. Russia, China and the US itself are all said to have researched microwaves for military purposes but Moscow has dismissed accusations as \"fanciful hypotheses\".\n\nWhat did the report find?\r\n\r\nAccording to details of the report published by the New York Times, the mysterious ailment is unlikely to have been caused by Russia or another foreign adversary. The reports said the CIA did not rule out foreign involvement in the cases that remain unexplained, which continue to be investigated.\r\n\r\n“In hundreds of other cases of possible symptoms, the agency has found plausible, alternate explanations,\" according to NBC sources.\r\n\r\nBut CIA Director Bill Burns said in a statement that the mission to investigate these incidents will continue. \"While we have reached some significant findings, we are not done... we will continue the mission to investigate these incidents and provide access to world-class care for those who need it,\" said Burns.\n\nControversy over CIA's findings\r\n\r\nThe interim findings elicited frustration from some of those who fell ill. This includes the current and former officials who have been battling chronic ailments for years without an explanation. A group of such people said the CIA assessment “cannot and must not be the final word on the matter\", according to a statement cited by the New York Times.\n\nLast Updated 21 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "Calling for the United Nations to recognise ‘Hinduphobia’ along with other acts of religious hatred against Buddhism and Sikhism, India’s U.N. envoy T.S.Tirumurti said that the U.N.’s latest Global Counter-Terrorism strategy passed last year is full of flaws and is selective, and could reverse gains from the global consensus in the “war on terror” post 9/11. In remarks indicating the government’s discomfort with new terms being added to the definition of terrorism, he also said that terms like “violent nationalism” and “right wing extremism” must not be included to resolutions on terrorism, as they would “dilute” them.\n\n“In the past two years, several member states, driven by their political, religious and other motivations, have been trying to label terrorism into categories such as racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism, violent nationalism, right wing extremism, etc. This tendency is dangerous for several reasons,” Mr. Tirumurti said, delivering a keynote address at a virtual conference organised by the Delhi-based Global Counter-Terrorism Centre (GCTC), where he said he spoke as Ambassador of India to the U.N. and not in his capacity as Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) at the U.N. Security Council for 2022.\n\nIndia assumed the chair of the CTC this month, and Mr. Tirumurti’s strong remarks suggest that India will oppose any expansion of the terms that are included in the UNSC’s discussions on terrorism, until it demits the UNSC seat in December this year.\n\nMr. Tirumurti pointed out that only religious phobias against “Abrahamic religions”: Islam, Christianity and Judaism had been named in the “Global Counter Terrorism Strategy’s” 7th review passed by the U.N. General Assembly in June 2021. “The emergence of contemporary forms of religiophobia, especially anti-Hindu, anti-Buddhist and anti-Sikh phobias is a matter of serious concern and needs attention of the U.N. and all member states to address this threat,” Mr. Tirumurti said, without mentioning any examples.\n\nIn comments that appeared to counter recent criticism in western press of “right-wing” ideology in India, the envoy said that putting “labels” to “so-called” threats was “misleading and erroneous”.\n\n“It is important to understand that in democracies right-wing and left-wing are part of the polity primarily because they come to power through the ballot reflecting the majority will of the people and also since democracy by definition contains a broad spectrum of ideologies and beliefs,” Mr. Tirumurti said, adding that national or regional narratives must not become part of global narratives.\n\nMr. Tirumurti said that attempts to characterise the motivation behind terror groups were another danger that could take the world “back to the pre 9/11-era” where groups were labelled as “your terrorists and my terrorists”. At the UNSC, India also chairs the 1988 Taliban Sanctions Committee, and would have to preside over any requests on easing or waiving sanctions against Taliban leaders.\n\n“Terrorists are terrorists; there are no good and bad ones.Those who propagate this distinction have an agenda. And those who cover up for them are just as culpable,” he said, calling on the Security Council “to be on guard against new terminologies and false priorities that can dilute our focus”.\n\nLast Updated 21 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "The Amar Jawan Jyoti, the eternal flame burning continuously for five decades at India Gate in honour of soldiers who died for the country, was put out Friday after being merged with the flame at the National War Memorial a few hundred metres away.\r\n\r\nThe move triggered a political firestorm with the Opposition accusing the government of attempting to rewrite history, a charge that members of the establishment and the ruling party rejected.\r\n\r\nAmid the furore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that a “grand statue” of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will be installed beneath the empty canopy at India Gate – it has been vacant since 1968 when the statue of King George V was removed and taken to Coronation Park in northwest Delhi.\n\nSaying Netaji’s statue there will be “a symbol of India’s indebtedness to him,” the Prime Minister, in a Twitter post, said: “At a time when the entire nation is marking the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I am glad to share that his grand statue, made of granite, will be installed at India Gate. This would be a symbol of India’s indebtedness to him.”\r\n\r\n“Till the grand statue of Netaji Bose is completed, a hologram statue of his would be present at the same place. I will unveil the hologram statue on 23rd January, Netaji’s birth anniversary,” he said.\r\n\r\nHailing the announcement, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said: “This decision is a national expression of respect for Netaji by a grateful nation on the occasion of his 125th birth anniversary. With the installation of the statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the inspiration of patriotism, self-respect and valour will be awakened in the minds of the people of India and future generations, and the spirit of sacrificing everything for maintaining the independence of the country will be ignited. Congratulations and thanks to the Prime Minister for this decision.”\r\n\r\nTaking a dig at the Congress, Home Minister Amit Shah said: “Netaji is an epitome of India’s true strength and resolve. The Congress has left no stone unturned to forget the immortal contributions of India’s brave son. Prime Minister Modi’s decision to install Netaji’s statue at India Gate on his 125th Jayanti will inspire our generations to come.” He said the decision was “great news for the entire nation” and “this is a befitting tribute to the legendary Netaji, who gave everything for India’s freedom”.\r\n\r\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman called it a “welcome decision” and a “fitting tribute to the great hero”, and said: “In the hearts of all Indians, there is undiminished respect for Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.”\n\nThe decision to install a statue of Netaji at India Gate is politically and historically symbolic. The BJP has often accused the Congress of having ignored the contributions of many from the pantheon of freedom fighters.\r\n\r\nAt the Amar Jawan Jyoti, in a short and solemn ceremony, presided over by Air Marshal BR Krishna, Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee, a part of the flame was taken and merged with the flame at the National War Memorial with full military honours.\r\n\r\nThe Amar Jawan Jyoti was established in 1972 to mark India’s victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh. The then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi had inaugurated it on Republic Day in 1972.\r\n\r\nThe Amar Jawan Jyoti is an iconic symbol. Live TV coverage of the Republic Day parade, watched by millions every year, always began with visuals of the flame and homage being paid to the fallen soldiers. The flame there has now been merged with the one at the National War Memorial, burning ever since its inauguration in 2019.\n\nThe sandstone canopy where Netaji’s statue will be installed was constructed in 1936. It has been vacant ever since the statue of King George V was moved to the Coronation Park.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, there were deliberations in successive governments to install a statue of Mahatma Gandhi there. Some historians were of the view that the canopy should be symbolically kept empty – as a silent reminder of India’s past.\n\nSources in the Ministry of Culture say while the graphic model of the 28×6 feet statue has been readied by a team from the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), and has been approved by the PMO, they are shortlisting a sculptor to execute it.\r\n\r\n“It won’t take more than a few months before the actual statue is ready,” sources said, adding that the installation will be done this year itself, to coincide with 75 years of Independence celebrations, the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav,” sources said.\r\n\r\nA senior government functionary privy to the developments, who didn’t wish to be identified, called it an attempt to “decolonise our monuments”.\n\n“This move shouldn’t be seen in isolation. In fact, when Bose’s 125th birth anniversary celebration was launched on January 23, 2021, it started with packing off British relics from the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata and turning it into a museum dedicated to the life and times of the iconic leader. It’s an attempt to decolonise British-era monuments and reclaim them, and what can be better than India Gate, situated in the heart of the national capital, to conclude the year-long celebrations,” the government functionary said.\r\n\r\nLast Updated 22 Jan'22",

It once housed a statue of the former king of England George V, which was moved to Coronation Park in the 1960s. Coronation Park is located on Burari Road in northwest Delhi, and was the venue of the first Delhi Durbar of 1877 when Queen Victoria was proclaimed the Empress of India. \n\nLater, the same place was used to celebrate the accession of King Edward VII in 1903, and, finally, it was here that the Durbar commemorating the coronation of King George V as Emperor of India took place on 12 December 1911. Following the independence of India on August 15, 1947, some of the statues of former British kings (including the 49-feet marble statue of George V at Rajpath), governors and officials were moved to Coronation Park from various locations across Delhi.\n\nLast Updated 22 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "A Taliban delegation led by acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday started three days of talks in Oslo with Western government officials and Afghan civil society representatives amid a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.\n\nThe closed-door meetings are taking place at a hotel in the snow-capped mountains above the Norwegian capital. The first day will see Taliban representatives meeting with women’s rights activists and human rights defenders from Afghanistan and from the Afghan diaspora.\n\nBefore the talks, the Taliban’s deputy minister of culture and information tweeted a voice message he said was from Muttaqi, expressing hope for “a good trip full of achievements” and thanking Norway, a country he said he hopes will become “a gateway for a positive relationship with Europe.”\n\nThe trip is the first time since the Taliban took over the country in August that their representatives have held official meetings in Europe. Earlier, they traveled to Russia, Iran, Qatar, Pakistan, China and Turkmenistan.\n\nDuring the talks, Muttaqi is certain to press the Taliban’s demand that nearly $10 billion frozen by the United States and other Western countries be released as Afghanistan faces a precarious humanitarian situation.\n\nThe United Nations has managed to provide for some liquidity and allowed the new administration to pay for imports, including electricity, but warned that as many as 1 million Afghan children are in danger of starving, and most of the country’s 38 million people are living below the poverty line.\n\nThe Norwegian Foreign Ministry said the Taliban delegation would also meet with Afghans in Norway, including “women leaders, journalists and people who work with, among other things, human rights and humanitarian, economic, social and political issues.”\n\n“Norway continues to engage in dialogue with the Taliban to promote human rights, women’s participation in society, and to strengthen humanitarian and economic efforts in Afghanistan in support of the Afghan people,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nA U.S. delegation, led by Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West, plans to discuss “the formation of a representative political system; responses to the urgent humanitarian and economic crises; security and counterterrorism concerns; and human rights, especially education for girls and women,” according to a statement released by the U.S. State Department.\n\nOn Friday, Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt stressed that the visit was “not a legitimation or recognition of the Taliban. But we must talk to those who in practice govern the country today.”\n\nOn Friday, Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt stressed that the visit was “not a legitimation or recognition of the Taliban. But we must talk to those who in practice govern the country today.”\n\n”We are extremely concerned about the serious situation in Afghanistan,” Huitfeldt said, noting that economic and political conditions have created “a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe for millions of people” facing starvation in the country.\n\nThe Scandinavian country, home to the Nobel Peace Prize, is no stranger to sensitive diplomacy and has in the past been involved in peace efforts in a number of countries, including Mozambique, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Syria, Myanmar, Somalia, Sri Lanka and South Sudan.\n\nLast Updated 24 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "In public discourse and popular imagination Subhas Chandra Bose and the stalwarts of the Congress Party like Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi are often seen at odds with each other. The Bose-Gandhi rivalry is frequently understood as the biggest dichotomy of the Indian nationalist movement, its narrative often picked up by parties now to futher their own agenda.\n\n“Subhas Chandra Bose was a key member and a frontline leader of the Indian National Congress. He plunged into the anti-colonial movement under Gandhi’s leadership in 1921 and rose to be the president of the Congress in 1938 and 39,” reminded Sugato Bose, Professor of History at Harvard University. “There were certain differences of opinion with the Gandhian high command in 1939, but he remained true to the Congress ideal of freedom,” he added.\n\n“Bose was a complex character,” explained historian Ramachandra Guha in an Indian Express Idea Exchange session. His complexity comes alive when one realises that despite his disagreement with the Congress leadership, when Bose took over the Indian National Army (INA), he constituted four regiments, three of which were named after Gandhi, Nehru and Maulana Azad. “He had profound respect for his colleagues,” said Guha. In 1943, while Gandhi was in jail, Bose on the former’s birthday gave a moving address over the Azad Hind Radio where he referred to Gandhi as ‘father of the nation’. As Guha noted, this was probably the first time this epithet was used for Gandhi, and soon it became ubiquitous.\n\nOn July 16, 1921, Bose had returned to Bombay from London where he had gone on his father’s insistence to prepare for the Indian Civil Services examination. Despite qualifying for the services he had refused to take up the opportunity. In a letter to brother Sarat Bose, in September, 1920, he wrote: “It is not possible to serve one’s country in the best and fullest manner if one is chained on to the civil service” — as reproduced by historian Leonard Gordon in his book, ‘Brothers Against the Raj: A Biography of Indian Nationalist Leaders Sarat and Subhas Chandra Bose’.\n\nMukherjee compared Bose’s relationship with Gandhi to that of Nehru, both leaders being of the same age of similar political leanings and often finding themselves frustrated by Gandhi’s commitment to non-violence. However, while Nehru was starry-eyed in his reverence for Gandhi, Bose though immensely respectful of Gandhi, found his political strategies to be ambiguous.\n\nMukherjee compared Bose’s relationship with Gandhi to that of Nehru, both leaders being of the same age of similar political leanings and often finding themselves frustrated by Gandhi’s commitment to non-violence. However, while Nehru was starry-eyed in his reverence for Gandhi, Bose though immensely respectful of Gandhi, found his political strategies to be ambiguous.\n\nIn February 1922, Gandhi had unilaterally called off the non-cooperation movement on account of the outbreak of violence at Chauri Chaura. Both Bose and Nehru had been in prison at that time and both expressed disappointment and anger in knowing that the movement they had worked so hard for, had been forced to wind up.\n\nLast Updated 24 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "With two nuclear powered aircraft carrier strike groups patrolling the Philippines Sea and another one forwardly deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, the US has sent a strong message to China to stay away from Taiwan while the former is locked with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nThe PLA on Sunday responded to the massive US naval drills by sending as many as 39 warplanes, largely fighters like J-10 and J-16, into Taiwan’s south-western air defense identification zone (ADIZ) as tensions escalated over the breakaway island country. The Taiwan air force resumed combat air patrol and activated surface to air missile systems to deter the aggressive PLA Air Force. This is the first time after October 2021 that the PLA has responded to US drills with so many fighters.\n\nThis large-scale Taiwan airspace transgression by Chinese fighter took place when the US Navy has three aircraft carrier strike groups in support of Taipei and freedom of navigation operations in Philippines Sea. While USS Carl Vinson and Abraham Lincoln are patrolling near Taiwan, the USS Ronald Reagan is on standby near Yokosuka in Japan. The US has also large scale marine presence with presence of USS Essex amphibious ready group and USS America expeditionary strike group joining the aircraft carriers. Patrolling with the massive carrier force is Japanese Hyuga class helicopter destroyer with USS strike groups deploying as many as 26 F-35 fifth generation fighters.\n\nThe US Navy build-up near Taiwan is a clear message to China that it cannot have a free pass to Taipei while Washington is locked up in a confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. “The message to China is that US has not taken off its eyes from Beijing and wants PLA to stay away from Taiwan till such time the Ukraine crisis gets resolved,” said a former Indian ambassador to US.\n\nSince the US-Russia escalation over Ukraine has started, many believed that this would give President Xi Jinping a free pass to aggressively pursue what China calls its core interests. The Biden administration has this month already conveyed to China that it is watching PLA build-up in Ladakh as the India-China stand-off on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) completes second winter on Tibetan plateau.\n\nLast Updated 25 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "China’s Air Force sent 52 aircraft towards Taiwan on Sunday and Monday in its latest show of force aimed at the island, prompting jets to be scrambled in response.\n\nTaiwan’s Defence Ministry said 39 PLA aircraft had entered Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) on Sunday, while 13 more aircraft did so on Monday. The first group included 34 J-16 fighters jets, four electronic warfare planes and one H-6 bomber, while on Monday there were 10 J-16s, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft.\n\nThe Ministry said Taiwan had scrambled jets and issued radio warnings in response.\n\nChina has in the past sent aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ — but short of entering Taiwan’s airspace — as a show of force or signalling often coinciding with political developments or military exercises.\n\nOctober last year saw an unprecedented rise in aerial incursions into the ADIZ, and after a record 56 aircraft flew into the ADIZ on a single day last year, Taiwan’s Defence Minister was prompted to describe the cross-strait situation as the most strained he had seen in 40 years.\n\nU.S.-Japan drills:\nReports in the Chinese media suggested the latest aerial intrusions into the ADIZ may have been timed to coincide with recently concluded U.S.-Japan drills. Last year, the intrusions coincided with China’s National Day on October 1 and ahead of the “double ten” National Day celebrated in Taiwan on October 10.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its province, although both have been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Ties have plummeted and Beijing has stepped up pressure, including by weaning away the few remaining countries that maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, after the election of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Tsai Ing-wen in 2016. Ms. Tsai was re-elected as President for a second term after a landslide win in 2020.\n\nBeijing has accused the DPP of pursuing “independence”, while Ms. Tsai has said Taiwan only wishes to maintain the current status quo and would “prevent the status quo of being unilaterally altered” by Beijing.\n\nLast Updated 25 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "The James Webb Space Telescope has arrived at its cosmic parking spot a million miles away, bringing it a step closer to its mission to unravel the mysteries of the Universe, NASA said Monday.\n\nAt around 2:00 pm Eastern Time (1900 GMT), the observatory fired its thrusters for five minutes to reach the so-called second Lagrange point, or L2, where it will have access to nearly half the sky at any given moment.\n\nThe delicate burn added 3.6 miles per hour (1.6 meters per second) to Webb's overall speed, just enough to bring it into a \"halo\" orbit around L2, 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.\n\n\"Webb, welcome home!\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement.\n\nWebb will begin its science mission by summer, which includes using its high resolution infrared instruments to peer back in time 13.5 billion years to the first generation of galaxies that formed after the Big Bang.\n\nAt L2, it will stay in line with the Earth as it moves around the Sun, allowing Webb's sunshield to protect its sensitive equipment from heat and light.\n\nFor the giant parasol to offer effective protection, it needs the Sun, Earth and Moon to all be in the same direction, with the cold side operating at -370 degrees Fahrenheit (-225 Celsius).\n\nThe thruster firing, known as an orbital burn, was the third such maneuver since Webb was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket on December 25.\n\nThe plan was intentional, because if Webb had gotten too much thrust from the rocket, it wouldn't be able to turn around to fly back to Earth, as that would expose its optics to the Sun, overheating and destroying them.\n\nIt was therefore decided to slightly underburn the rocket firing and use the telescope's own thrusters to make up the difference.\n\nThe burns went so well that Webb should easily be able to exceed its planned minimum life of five years, Keith Parrish Webb observatory commissioning manager told reporters on a call.\n\n\"Around 20 years, we think that's probably a good ballpark, but we're trying to refine that,\" he said. It's hypothetically possible, but not anticipated, that a future mission could go there and refuel it.\n\nWebb, which is expected to cost NASA nearly $10 billion, is one of the most expensive scientific platforms ever built, comparable to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and its predecessor telescope, Hubble.\n\nHalo orbit\n\nBut while Hubble orbits the Earth, Webb will orbit in an area of space known as a Lagrange point, where the gravitational pull from the Sun and Earth will be balanced by the centrifugal force of the rotating system.\n\nAn object at one of these five points, first theorized by Italian French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, will remain stable and not fall into the gravity well of the Sun and Earth, requiring only a little fuel for adjustments.\n\nWebb won't sit precisely at L2, but rather go around it in a \"halo\" at a distance similar to that between the Earth and Moon, completing a cycle every six months.\n\nThis will allow the telescope to remain thermally stable and to generate power from its solar panels.\n\nPrevious missions to L2 include the European Space Agency's Herschel and Planck observatories, and NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.\n\nWebb's position will also allow continuous communications with Earth via the Deep Space Network -- three large antennas in Australia, Spain and California.\n\nEarlier this month, NASA completed the process of unfolding Webb's massive golden mirror that will collect infrared signals from the first stars and galaxies that formed a few hundred million years after the Universe began expanding.\n\nVisible and ultraviolet light emitted by the very first luminous objects has been stretched by the Universe's expansion, and arrives today in the form of infrared, which Webb is equipped to detect with unprecedented clarity.\n\nIts mission also includes the study of distant planets, known as exoplanets, to determine their origin, evolution and habitability.\n\nNext steps include aligning the telescope's optics and calibrating its scientific instruments. It is expected to transmit its first images back in June or July.\n\nLast Updated 25 Jan'22",

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that US defense secretary Lloyd Austin's order to place 8,500 military personnel to heightened preparedness would allow America to rapidly deploy additional brigade combat teams, along with units.\n\nKirby told reporters that giving time to prepare the US military personnel enough time to prepare makes “prudent sense” in case Nato activates its Response Force as Russia has “no intention right now of de-escalating”. The US forces placed on alert would be in addition to the significant combat-capable troops already based in Europe “to deter aggression and enhance the alliance’s ability to defend allies and defeat aggression if necessary,” said Kirby.\n\n\"Again, I want to reinforce that as of now the decision has been made to put these units on higher alert and higher alert only,\" Kirby said. \"No decisions have been made to deploy any forces from the United States at this time.\"While Russia has denied intention to invade Ukraine, its aggression along the border has caused concern to the West, prompting a visit to Kyiv by US state secretary Antony Blinken and meeting with European allies. US President Joe Biden also held what he called a “great” call with European leaders as they work to strike a unified position on Russia.\n\nBiden had said that the US, in case of an invasion, would respond with stringent economic sanctions but the latest order indicates that the US President wants to send a stronger military message to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, as fears of invasion grow.\n\n\"As [President Joe Biden] has made clear, the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us, our allies or partners,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nLast Updated 25 Jan'22",

Then Naik went on to dig the seventh tunnel behind his house to provide water for drinking and domestic use.\n\nThis year the President has approved conferment of 128 Padma Awards including 2 duo case.

      "newsdata": "President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday said the country has shown unmatched resolve in the face of the extraordinary challenge posed to humankind by the coronavirus pandemic, and asserted that a strong and sensitive India is now emerging.\r\n\r\nAddressing the nation on the eve of 73rd Republic Day, President Kovind noted that democracy, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity form the bedrock of India, and urged the people to celebrate “Indian-ness” this Republic Day.\r\n\r\nHe stressed that the observance of the Fundamental Duties mentioned in the Constitution creates the proper environment for the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights, and cited people’s participation in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and in COVID-19 vaccination as examples of citizens fulfilling their fundamental duties and rendering a national service.\r\n\r\nAs Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, the President said that this year was a watershed year for women’s empowerment, with “India’s daughters breaking a glass ceiling as Permanent Commission has now been allowed for women officers in new areas and our armed forces will benefit from better gender balance”.\n\nPresident Kovind urged citizens to not lower their guard and keep following COVID-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance as the virus keeps making comebacks with new mutations.\r\n\r\n“It has been an extraordinary challenge to humankind. The pandemic management was bound to be all the more difficult in India. We have a high population density and, as a developing economy, we did not have the level of resources and infrastructure needed to battle this invisible enemy. But it is only in such difficult times that the resilience of a nation shines forth. I am proud to say that we have shown an unmatched resolve against the coronavirus,” President Kovind said.\r\n\r\n“There have been setbacks, unfortunately, as the virus makes a comeback with new mutations. Countless families have gone through a harrowing time. There are no words to express our collective trauma. The only saving grace is that many lives could be saved. As the pandemic is still widespread, we must remain alert and not let our guard down,” he said.\r\n\r\nDoctors, nurses and paramedics have risen to the challenge, working long hours in difficult conditions even at risk to their lives to attend to patients. Others have kept the nation moving, managing supply chains and utilities, he said.\r\n\r\nLauding the timely interventions by the country’s leadership, policy-makers, administrators and others at the Central and State levels during coronavirus pandemic, the President said it was a testimony to India’s spirit that the economy is on the move again, and is projected to grow at an impressive rate in this fiscal after a year of contraction.\r\n\r\n“The impressive economic performance is made possible due to improvement in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors. I am happy to note that our farmers, especially young farmers with small holdings, are enthusiastically adopting natural farming,” the President said.\r\n\r\nThe President, who delivered his last address to the nation on the eve of Republic Day before his Presidency this July, thanked the constant vigil of the armed forces in securing the borders, and police personnel in maintaining internal security within the country.\r\n\r\n“It is our soldiers and security personnel who carry on the legacy of national pride. In the unbearable cold of the Himalayas and in the excruciating heat of the desert, far away from their families, they continue to guard the motherland. It is thanks to the constant vigil of the armed forces securing our borders and the police personnel maintaining internal security within the country that their fellow citizens enjoy a peaceful life,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe said that when a brave soldier dies on duty, the entire country feels sad, and remembered General Bipin Rawat, one of the bravest commanders, passing away in a tragic accident along with his wife and other brave soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe President noted that India is an ancient civilisation but a young republic and nation-building is a constant endeavour.\r\n\r\n“Patriotism strengthens the sense of duty among citizens. Whether you are a doctor or a lawyer, a shopkeeper or office-worker, a sanitation employee or a labourer, doing one’s duty well and efficiently is the first and foremost contribution you make to the nation,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am confident that India is better placed today to meet the challenges of the future,” he noted, adding that new opportunities await the next generation.\n\nLast Updated 26 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "Ukraine has become the main flashpoint in Moscow’s relations with the West, with Russian troops massed near its border and NATO’s forces on standby in case Russia attacks its neighbour.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the reasons why Russian President Vladimir Putin is so preoccupied with Ukraine and why he has chosen to bring the crisis to a head now.\r\n\r\nSince the Cold War ended, NATO has expanded eastwards by taking in 14 new countries, including the states of the former Warsaw Pact and the three Baltic nations that were once in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nRussia saw this as a threatening encroachment towards its borders and continues to say it was a betrayal of Western promises at the start of the 1990s – something the United States and its allies deny.\r\n\r\nUkraine is not a NATO member but has a promise dating from 2008 that it will eventually get to join. Since toppling a pro-Russian president in 2014, it has become closer politically to the West, staged joint military exercises with NATO and taken delivery of weapons including U.S. Javelin anti-tank missiles and Turkish drones.\r\n\r\nKyiv and Washington see these as legitimate moves to bolster Ukraine’s defence after Russia seized the Crimea region in 2014 and provided backing to separatists who are still fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine.\r\n\r\nPutin says Ukraine’s growing ties with the alliance could make it a launchpad for NATO missiles targeted at Russia. He says Russia needs to lay down “red lines” to prevent that.\r\n\r\nRussia rejects Ukrainian and U.S. suspicions it may be preparing an invasion of Ukraine, saying it is responding to threats and provocations.\r\n\r\nIt wants security guarantees from the West including the rescinding of NATO’s membership promise to Kyiv – something Washington has called a non-starter.\r\n\r\n• Geography and resources\r\nUkraine is the second biggest country in Europe after Russia itself, has major ports on the Black Sea and shares borders with four NATO countries. It is a major exporter of corn and wheat. Europe depends on Russia for about one third of its natural gas – providing leverage for Putin in any dispute with the West – and one of the main pipelines passes through Ukraine.\r\n\r\nControlling the Ukrainian territory that it crosses would enhance Russia’s pipeline security and protect its ability to “weaponise” energy supplies. Most analysts, though, consider it unlikely that Russia would attempt to seize and defend large swathes of Ukrainian territory because the military cost would be too high.\r\n\r\n• History\r\nWith the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia lost control of 14 former republics it had previously dominated, but the loss of Ukraine was the most painful. The two had been linked since the 9th century when Kyiv became the capital of the ancient state of Rus; in 988 its ruler, Grand Prince Vladimir, introduced Orthodox Christianity. From 1654, Russia and Ukraine were united by treaty under the rule of the Russian tsar.\r\n\r\nThe two countries speak closely related languages and later formed, with Belarus, the Slav core of the Soviet Union. Many Russians feel a connection with Ukraine that they do not feel with other former Soviet republics in the Baltics, Caucasus and Central Asia.\r\n\r\nPutin alluded to this in a long essay in June 2021 in which he said Russians and Ukrainians were one people who shared a single “historic and spiritual space” and that the emergence of a “wall” between them in recent years was tragic.\r\n\r\nKyiv rejected his argument as a politically motivated and over-simplified version of history.\r\n\r\n• Putin’s mindset and motives\r\nPutin, who once called the break-up of the Soviet Union the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the last century, has devoted his presidency to restoring Moscow’s influence throughout the post-Soviet space, defying the West and trying to reassert Russia as a global power.\r\n\r\nKeeping the world guessing about a possible invasion of Ukraine is consistent with those aims. It has forced Russia’s security demands to the top of the international agenda and compelled U.S. President Joe Biden to re-engage with Putin, although it has also drawn Western warnings of drastic international sanctions.\r\n\r\nPutin’s impassioned public statements on Ukraine suggest his actions are driven by personal conviction as well as politics. Events there have defined the lows and highs of his rule – pro-Western revolutions in 2004 and 2014 dealt blows to Russian interests, but Putin presented the seizure of Crimea as a historic victory.\r\n\r\nAfter 22 years as Russia’s paramount leader, some analysts believe he may be pondering his own legacy and looking to complete unfinished business in Ukraine by blocking its westward shift and reclaiming it as part of a Russian sphere of influence – something that Ukraine, NATO and the United States all say they will never accept.\r\n\r\nLast Updated on 27 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "After several delays due to the coronavirus pandemic and successive lockdowns, the Indian Space & Research Organisation (Isro) is picking up pace as it gets its new chief in Dr S Somnath. The senior rocket scientists said that the space agency will conduct five major satellite launches in the coming three months, as he briefed the Minister of Science & Technology Dr Jitendra Singh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Isro chairman presented a brief about the forthcoming missions during the next three months, which include a RICAT-1A PSLV C5-2 launch scheduled for February this year, followed by the launch of OCEANSAT-3 and INS 2B ANAND PSLV C-53 in March, and SSLV-D1 Micro SAT in April 2022.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Isro will also launch GSAT-21, the first fully funded satellite by the New Space India Limited (NSIL). The communication satellite will be developed and operated by NSIL to meet the Direct to Home (DTH) application needs.\r\n\r\nFollowing the meeting, the minister said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, space programmes have been given a special impetus and space technology has now been made applicable in different sectors including roads and highways, railways, healthcare, agriculture. \"During the next few years, India’s ascent to the top will be heralded via the Space route,\" the minister said.\r\n\r\nGAGANYAAN: DELAYED, BUT BACK ON TRACK\r\nBriefing the minister on India's maiden manned mission Gaganyaan, Somnath said that there had been a delay in the timeline because of the Covid-19 and other constraints, but now things have again fallen back on track and all the systems needed for the first unmanned mission are being readied.\r\n\r\nIsro is planning to launch the first uncrewed mission under Gaganyaan in 2022, following which the second unmanned mission “Vyommitra” will carry a robot and this will then be followed by the manned mission. The Isro chairman said that the selected Indian astronauts have successfully undergone Generic Space Flight Training in Russia and an ad-hoc astronaut training centre has also been established at Bengaluru.\r\n\r\nThe Isro chief further said that the preparations for the manned mission involve in-flight demonstration of the Crew Escape System functioning in the lower atmosphere (less than 10 Kms). The exercise recovery of the crew module after impacting the sea is also being worked out.\r\n\r\nAfter being appointed as Isro chief for a term of three years, the senior scientist said that India needed new players in the space sector to make “economically viable programmes”. Somanath, who served as the director of Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram, was instrumental in the development of the GSLV Mk-III launcher and was a team leader for the Integration of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) during the early phases of his career.\r\n\r\n\"My best wishes to him for taking over a prestigious assignment at an eventful time when India is heading for its first Human Space mission\"Gaganyaan\" &other historic breakthroughs,\" Dr Jitendra Singh tweeted after the meeting.\r\n\r\nLast Updated on 27 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "Pakistan has raised a whopping $1 billion loan through the Sukuk bond at a record 7.95% interest rate, the highest cost that the cash-strapped country has agreed to pay in its history on an Islamic bond, and has also agreed to pledge a portion of the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway in return for the much-needed loan, media reports said on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Finance said the country had to raise the loan to keep the official foreign exchange reserves at their levels ahead of some major foreign loans’ repayments, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.\r\n\r\nThe government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan went to international capital markets after it consumed nearly $2 billion out of the $3 billion borrowed from Saudi Arabia one-and-half months ago, which brought down the gross official foreign exchange reserves to $17 billion as of January 14, it said.\r\n\r\nPakistan has issued the 7-year tenor asset-backed Sukuk bond to raise $1 billion at an interest rate of 7.95%, the Ministry of Finance said.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rate is almost half percent higher than even the 10-year Eurobond that the government had floated in April last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key difference between the Islamic Sukuk and traditional Eurobond is that the Islamic bond is backed by an asset that attracts less interest rate.\r\n\r\nHowever, the government has paid the interest rate on an asset-backed bond, which is higher than the traditional tenor bond.\r\n\r\nPakistan has agreed to pledge a portion of the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway (M2) in return for the loan -- a national asset built in the 1990s that is now used to raise debt from the international capital markets.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Ministry of Finance said that a nearly 8% interest rate should be seen in the context of a rise in the interest cost around the globe after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated increasing the interest rates from March.\r\n\r\nThe ministry received over $3 billion bids at the indicated rates.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal year 2017, Pakistan had borrowed $1 billion for five years through Sukuk at a 5.625% interest rate -- which at that time was 5% higher than the benchmark five-year U.S. paper.\r\n\r\nNearly 8% interest rate is not only significantly higher than the previous Islamic bond deal but is also nearly 6.3% higher than the seven-year U.S. benchmark rate.\r\n\r\nIt is the highest rate that Pakistan has ever paid in its history on an Islamic bond, which indicates the desperation of the country that has long been building its official foreign exchange reserves by taking expensive foreign loans.\r\n\r\nLast month, Pakistan had taken a $3 billion Saudi loan on very tough conditions after its official gross foreign exchange reserves dipped below $16 billion.\r\n\r\nHowever, the reserves again fell slightly over $17 billion as of January 14, indicating that the government has already eaten up nearly $2 billion of the Saudi loan.\r\n\r\nThe current account deficit has widened to $9.1 billion during the first half of the current fiscal year -- a figure that is almost equal to the level State Bank Governor Dr Reza Baqir had projected for the full fiscal year.\r\n\r\nIn August last year, Dr Baqir had said that the current account deficit would remain in the range of $6.5 billion to $9.5 billion in the current fiscal year 2021-22. But the threshold is almost breached six months before the close of the fiscal year.\r\n\r\nCompared with short-term expensive commercial borrowing, long-term bonds are considered the preferred choice of instruments due to their longer maturity and no conditions attached.\r\n\r\nHowever, the kind of interest rates that the PTI government is offering to foreign investors is unprecedented in the history of the country, the report said.\r\n\r\nIt is the second time in the current fiscal year that the government is conducting the capital market transaction. Earlier it had raised $1 billion in July last year, according to The Express Tribune report.\r\n\r\nLast Updated on 27 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "Two days after China held a virtual summit with Central Asian countries, India too stepped in and Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitched for “an integrated approach for regional connectivity and cooperation for the next 30 years”.\r\n\r\nHe also flagged Afghanistan as a common concern and said that their “mutual cooperation has become even more important for regional security and stability”.\n\n“We all have the same concerns and objectives for regional security. We are all concerned about the developments in Afghanistan,” Modi said at the first virtual summit with the Central Asian leaders. “In this context also, our mutual cooperation has become even more important for regional security and stability,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe virtual summit saw the participation of the five presidents — Kazakhstan’s Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Uzbekistan’s Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan’s Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow and Sadyr Japarov of Kyrgyz Republic. This was the first engagement of its kind between India and the Central Asian countries at the level of leaders.\n\nChina held a summit with the leaders of Central Asian countries on January 25, at a very short notice, after India had announced its summit. China’s President Xi Jinping had offered USD 500 million in assistance to the region and had vouched to strengthen trade with the countries.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Modi underlined the three main objectives of the summit.\r\n\r\nFirst, he said, “to make it clear that cooperation between India and Central Asia is essential for regional security and prosperity. From Indian point of view, I would like to emphasise that Central Asia is central to India’s vision of an integrated and stable extended neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\nThe second objective, he said, is to give “an effective structure to our cooperation. This will establish a framework of regular interactions at different levels and among various stakeholders.”\r\n\r\nAnd, the third objective is “to create an ambitious roadmap for our cooperation”.\r\n\r\n“Through this, we will be able to adopt an integrated approach for regional connectivity and cooperation for the next 30 years,” he said.\n\nThe summit is symbolic of the importance attached by the leaders of India and the Central Asian countries to a comprehensive and enduring India-Central Asia partnership.\r\n\r\nThe participation of the secretaries of National Security Councils of Central Asian countries in the Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan held in New Delhi in November last year outlined a common regional approach on Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThe summit is being held a day after Republic Day celebrations saw no foreign head of state or government as the chief guest. The leaders of the five central Asian countries were likely to be the chief guest, but the country saw a rise in COVID-19 cases which led to curtailed celebrations.\n\nModi underlined that the diplomatic relations between India and Central Asia countries have completed 30 meaningful years. “Our cooperation has achieved many successes over the past three decades. And now, at this crucial juncture, we must define an ambitious vision for the coming years as well. A vision that can fulfil the aspirations of our people, especially the younger generation, in the changing world,” he said.\r\n\r\nIn this context, Modi also underlined the importance of each of these countries.\r\n\r\nKazakhstan has become a vital partner for India’s energy security, he said, as he expressed condolences for the recent loss of life and property in Kazakhstan.\r\n\r\nOn Uzbekistan, he said, “Our state governments are also active partners in our growing cooperation with Uzbekistan. This includes my home state of Gujarat as well.”\n\nWith Kyrgyzstan, he said, “We have an active partnership with Kyrgyzstan in the field of education and high-altitude research. Thousands of Indian students are studying there.”\r\n\r\nWith Tajikistan, he said, “We have a longstanding cooperation in the field of security. And we are continuously strengthening it.”\n\nAnd, Turkmenistan, he said, “is an important part of Indian vision in the field of regional connectivity, which is evident from our participation in the Ashgabat Agreement”.\r\n\r\nThe first India-Central Asia Summit, the MEA said, is a reflection of the country’s growing engagement with the Central Asian countries, which are a part of India’s “extended neighbourhood”.\r\n\r\nModi had paid a visit to all Central Asian countries in 2015. Subsequently, there have been exchanges at high levels at bilateral and multilateral forums.\n\nLast Updated 28 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "The Biden administration and Nato told Russia on Wednesday there will be no US or Nato concessions on Moscow’s main demands to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.\r\n\r\nIn separate written responses delivered to the Russians, the US and Nato held firm to the alliance’s open-door policy for membership, rejected a demand to permanently ban Ukraine from joining, and said allied deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe are nonnegotiable.\r\n\r\n“There is no change, there will be no change,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Also not up for negotiation will be the US and European response to any Russian invasion of Ukraine, he said, repeating the mantra that any such incursion would be met with massive consequences and severe economic costs.\r\n\r\nThe responses were not unexpected and mirrored what senior US and Nato officials have been saying for weeks. Nonetheless, they and the eventual Russian reaction to them could determine whether Europe will again be plunged into war.\r\n\r\nThere was no immediate response from Russia but Russian officials have warned that Moscow would quickly take “retaliatory measures” if the US and its allies reject its demands.\n\nSeeking possible off-ramps that would allow Russia to withdraw the estimated 100,000 troops it has deployed near Ukraine’s border without appearing to have lost a battle of wills, the US response did outline areas in which some of Russia’s concerns might be addressed, provided it de-escalates tensions with Ukraine.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, Blinken said Russia would not be surprised by the contents of the several page American document that US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan delivered Wednesday to the Russian Foreign Ministry.\r\n\r\n“All told it sets out a serious diplomatic path forward, should Russia choose it,” he said. “The document we’ve delivered includes concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia’s actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground.”\r\n\r\nBlinken said he hoped to speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the response in the coming days. But he stressed the decision about pursuing diplomacy or conflict rests with Russia and more specifically with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\r\n\r\n“We’ll see how they respond,” he said. “But there’s no doubt in my mind that if Russia were to approach this seriously and in a spirit of reciprocity with a determination to enhance collective security for all of us, there are very positive things in this in this document that could be pursued. We can’t make that decision for President Putin.”\r\n\r\nShortly after Blinken spoke, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels that the alliance had sent a separate reply to Russia with an offer to improve communications, examine ways to avoid military incidents or accidents, and discuss arms control. But, like Blinken, he rejected any attempt to halt membership.\n\n“We cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which the security of our alliance, and security in Europe and North America rest,” Stoltenberg said. “This is about respecting nations and their right to choose their own path.”\r\n\r\n“Russia should refrain from coercive force posturing, aggressive rhetoric and malign activities directed against allies and other nations. Russia should also withdraw its forces from Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova where they are deployed without these countries’ consent,” he said.\r\n\r\nWhile flatly refusing to consider any changes to Nato’s open-door policy, its relationship with non-ally Ukraine, or allied troop and military deployments in Eastern Europe, Blinken said the US is open to other ideas to ease Russia’s stated concerns.\n\nThe US proposals, echoed in the Nato document, include the potential for negotiations over offensive missile placements and military exercises in Eastern Europe as well as broad arms control agreements as long as Russia withdraws its troops from the Ukrainian border and agrees to halt inflammatory rhetoric designed to deepen divisions and discord among the allies and within Ukraine itself.\r\n\r\nMoscow has demanded guarantees that Nato will never admit Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance will roll back troop deployments in former Soviet bloc nations. Some of these, like the membership pledge, are nonstarters for the US and its allies, creating a seemingly intractable stalemate that many fear can only end in a war.\r\n\r\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied it has plans to attack Ukraine, but the US and Nato are worried about Russia massing its troops near Ukraine and conducting a series of sweeping military maneuvers.\n\nAs part of the drills, motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia practiced firing live ammunition, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea performed bombing runs, dozens of warships sailed for training exercises in the Black Sea and the Arctic, and Russian fighter jets and paratroopers arrived in Belarus for joint war games.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Russian lawmakers on Wednesday before the US and Nato responses were delivered, Lavrov said he and other top officials will advise Putin on the next steps.\r\n\r\n“If the West continues its aggressive course, Moscow will take the necessary retaliatory measures,” Lavrov said.\r\n\r\nBut he indicated Russia wouldn’t wait forever. “We won’t allow our proposals to be drowned in endless discussions,” he said.\r\n\r\nAmid the tensions, the US, Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada have moved to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from Kyiv, a move that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sought to play down Tuesday as part of a “complex diplomatic game.”\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the US urged Americans in Ukraine to consider leaving, saying the security situation “continues to be unpredictable due to the increased threat of Russian military action and can deteriorate with little notice.”\r\n\r\nIn 2014, following the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled.\r\n\r\nEnvoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met Wednesday for more than five hours in Paris on the separatist conflict. Although there was no breakthrough, they promised to meet for new talks in two weeks in Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe French president’s office said afterward in a statement that the parties support “unconditional respect” for a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe talks focused on the 2015 Minsk peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict, and the statement didn’t address the current concerns about a Russian invasion of Ukraine.\r\n\r\n“Those are different issues, and we didn’t discuss it,” said Kremlin envoy Dmitry Kozak.\r\n\r\nUkrainian representative Andriy Yermak said the meeting marked the first real advance in talks since December 2019. He said the talks organised by the French and Germans were crucial “even when things were not so tense, and now we know it more than ever.”\r\n\r\nKozak said varying interpretations of the Minsk agreement have remained a major stumbling block. He said the four parties will make another attempt to reach consensus on the issue in two weeks.\r\n\r\nKozak reaffirmed that Russia isn’t a party to the conflict and emphasized that Ukraine is reluctant to engage in talks with separatists as stipulated in the Minsk document. He said there has been no progress on key aspects of the agreement that Ukraine must grant special status to the rebel regions, followed by elections.\n\nLast Updated 28 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "North Korea fired an \"unidentified projectile\" early Thursday, Seoul said, its sixth apparent weapons test this year as the nuclear-armed country flexes its military muscles and ignores Washington's offers of talks.\r\n\r\nThe last time North Korea tested this many weapons in a month was in 2019, after high-profile negotiations between leader Kim Jong Un and then-United States president Donald Trump collapsed.\r\n\r\nSince then, talks with the US have languished, and the country is reeling economically from biting international sanctions and a self-imposed coronavirus blockade.\r\n\r\n\"North Korea fired an unidentified projectile into the East Sea,\" Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the Sea of Japan.\r\n\r\nPyongyang fired two suspected cruise missiles on Tuesday, which are not banned under current UN sanctions on North Korea.\r\n\r\nIt also tested suspected ballistic missiles on January 14 and 17, and fired what it said were hypersonic missiles on January 5 and 11.\r\n\r\nThe string of sanction-busting tests drew global condemnation, including a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council meeting.\r\n\r\nThe United States also imposed new sanctions in response, prompting an angry reply from North Korea, which last week hinted that it could resume nuclear and long-range weapons tests.\r\n\r\nPyongyang has not tested intercontinental ballistic missiles or nukes since 2017, and has continued to observe a self-imposed moratorium even after diplomacy with the United States stalled.\n\n'Offensive weapons'\r\n\r\nThe North's saber-rattling comes at a delicate time in the region, with Kim's sole major ally China set to host the Winter Olympics next month and South Korea gearing up for a presidential election in March.\r\n\r\n\"The Kim regime is developing an impressive diversity of offensive weapons despite limited resources and serious economic challenges,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Seoul's Ewha University.\r\n\r\n\"Certain North Korean tests aim to develop new capabilities, especially for evading missile defenses,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Other launches are intended to demonstrate the readiness and versatility of missile forces that North Korea has already deployed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a decade in power, leader Kim has little to celebrate, with a Covid-battered economy causing food shortages at home, diplomacy with the United States stalled and biting sanctions taking their toll.\n\nThat may explain why North Korea has carried out five weapons tests in the last three weeks, analysts said earlier in the week -- and a dramatic demonstration of the nuclear-armed country's military prowess offers a quick win ahead of important domestic anniversaries.\r\n\r\nThe country is preparing to mark the 80th anniversary of the birth of Kim's father, late leader Kim Jong Il, in February, as well as the 110th birthday of the country's founding leader Kim Il Sung in April.\r\n\r\nIt may also be looking to conduct tests ahead of the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics next week, lest it anger its sole major ally China by raining missiles on its parade.\n\nLast Updated 28 Jan'22",

We don’t want wars. But we also won’t allow our interests to be rudely trampled, to be ignored,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian radio stations in an interview.\n\nRussia has massed tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border as it presses demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe.\n\nMr. Lavrov said the West was ignoring Russia’s interests but there was at least “something” in written responses submitted by the U.S. and NATO on Wednesday to Russia’s proposals.\n\nMr. Lavrov said he expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken again in the next couple of weeks. Their last meeting in Geneva produced no breakthrough but both sides agreed to keep talking.\n\nMr. Lavrov said, without giving details, that the U.S. counter-proposals were better than NATO’s. Russia was studying them and President Vladimir Putin would decide how to respond.\n\nWhile the U.S. and NATO responses have not been made public, both have stated they are willing to engage with Moscow on a series of topics, including arms control. The U.S. Ambassador to Moscow, John Sullivan, said Washington had raised the possibility of “reciprocal transparency measures... including on offensive weapons systems in Ukraine.”\n\nThe head of Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency told Reuters that Russia was prepared to attack Ukraine but added: “I believe that the decision to attack has not yet been made”.\n\nBelarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia, said his country had absolutely no interest in a war and that conflict would break out only if Belarus or Russia were directly attacked.\n\nThe Kremlin said Mr. Putin would spend a “lot of time” discussing European security issues with Chinese President Xi Jinping when he visits Beijing next week for the opening of the Winter Olympics.\n\nMr. Putin also plans a meeting with German business people, following talks with Italian executives on Wednesday at which he underlined the importance of energy ties between Russia and Italy.\n\nItaly’s government had urged companies not to take part in that call, at a moment when Western governments are trying to build unity over possible sanctions.\n\nNo date has been set for the German meeting, which could also be controversial, especially as Ukraine has expressed frustration over Berlin’s refusal to provide it with weapons to defend itself and what some countries sees as its ambivalence over possible sanctions against Russia.\n\nLast Updated 29 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "In a big boost to India’s defence exports, BrahMos Aerospace has inked a $375 million deal with the Philippines to provide the BrahMos cruise missile to the country’s navy. The Philippines navy will use this as an anti-ship shore-based missile that has a range of 290km.\n\nBrahMos Aerospace, a joint venture company between India's Defence Development and Research Organistation (DRDO) and Russia, has been continuously upgrading the missile system, making it more lethal against sea and land targets.\n\nBrahMos is one of the potent missile weapon systems used by the Indian military; already inducted into the Armed Forces and used by the army, air force and navy in different variants. It can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or land platforms.\n\nMeant to deter China\n\nA statement from department of national defense of the Philippines says the BrahMos will provide deterrence against any attempt to undermine sovereign rights in the Philippine Sea — a reference to the South China Sea where China maintains an aggressive posturing.\n\nAs the deal is finally through with the Philippines, other countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, who have shown interest in acquiring the anti-ship missile, could also come onboard. Malaysia and Vietnam are also claimants in the South China Sea.\n\nExperts are of the view that if India is successful in providing big-ticket military systems to countries in the neighbourhood, it won’t just be a boost for defence exports but will also be a strategic step to counter China’s influence as it provides defence products in Asia, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar.\n\nJump in Indian defence exports\n\nThere has been a monumental increase in India’s defence exports — jumping from Rs 1,940.64 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 8,434.84 crore, the Ministry of Defence had said in a reply to a Parliament question in December 2021.\n\nWhile the increase in exports is significant, the BrahMos deal with the Philippines is the first for a major military platform.\n\nThe Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) recently signed a contract with the government of Mauritius for exporting the advanced version of Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH Mark III). Mauritius already operates HAL built ALH and Do-228 aircraft.\n\nDepartment of Defence Produciton lists out Italy, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Russia, France, Nepal, Mauritius, Israel, Egypt, UAE, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, Poland, Spain and Chile as India’s export destinations for defence items.\n\nThe major defence items being exported listed are personal protective items, Offshore Patrol Vessels, Advanced Light Helicopter and surveillance systems.\n\nIn another reply last year to a Parliament question, the defence ministry informed that India exported items to 84 countries. These were not big-ticket miliary platforms or weapon systems. These were items like teargas launcher, night vision devices, fire control systems, weapon simulators and light weight torpedoes.\n\nExport target $5 billion by 2025\n\nIndia has set a target of exporting defence equipment worth Rs 35,000 crore ($5 billion) by 2025. Aimed at enhancing exports and build a domestic defence industry, the new policy aims at self-reliance looks to achieve a turnover of Rs 1,75,000 crore (25 billion US dollar). The policy also looks at doubling domestic procurement from the Indian industry.\n\nTo promote self-reliance and reduce imports, the defence ministry has also come out with a list of 2,851 items put in an impot embargo list aimed at saving Rs 3,000 crore annually with a ban on importing these items.\n\nHow India fares with other countries\n\nThe import ban list seems to be having an impact already. According to a study by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), there were three Indian companies in top 100 arms companies and their combined arms sales grew by 1.7 per cent.\n\nHowever, a comparison with China shows how Chinese companies have been racing ahead. “The combined arms sales of the five Chinese companies included in the top 100 amounted to an estimated $66.8 billion in 2020, 1.5 per cent more than in 2019. Chinese firms accounted for 13 per cent of total top 100 arms sales in 2020, behind the US companies and ahead of companies from the United Kingdom, which made up the third largest share,” the SIPRI report says.\n\nIt quotes Dr Nan Tian, SIPRI senior researcher: “In recent years, Chinese arms companies have benefited from the country’s military modernisation programmes and focus on military-civil fusion. They have become some of the most advanced military technology producers in the world.\" NORINCO, for example, co-developed the BeiDou military-civil navigation satellite system and deepened its involvement in emerging technologies.\n\nThe SIPRI report says while the United States has once again hosted the highest number of companies ranked in the top 100, Russian arms sales have declined for third year in a row.\n\n“Together, the arms sales of the 41 US companies amounted to $285 billion — an increase of 1.9 per cent compared with 2019 — and accounted for 54 per cent of the top 100’s total arms sales. Since 2018, the top five companies in the ranking have all been based in the USA,” the report said.\n\nIndia’s strategy to beef up defence exports\n\nThe Ministry of Defence has proposed a promotion body for exports that can advise the government on various export-related issues, coordinate all export facilitation schemes of the government, increase awareness amongst the industry about various export facilitation measures and promotion of exports through specific marketing efforts in targeted countries.\n\n“The body will identify the suitable export markets in consultation with ministry of external affairs and department of commerce, keeping in view our foreign policy and various international export control and arms control regimes,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nAs part of defence diplomacy aimed at enhancing exports, Indian missions have been asked to promote Indian defence exports. If required, industry delegations would be taken to target countries under the leadership of officials.\n\nLast Updated 29 Jan'22",

      "newsdata": "IN ITS first statement on the ongoing crisis between Russia and the West led by the US over Ukraine, India on Friday broke its silence and called for a “peaceful resolution” of the situation through “sustained diplomatic efforts” for “long-term peace and stability” in the region and beyond.\n\nThe Indian government’s position was articulated by Ministry of External Affairs’ official spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at the weekly briefing on Friday.\n\nIn response to questions, the MEA spokesperson said, “We have been closely following the developments relating to Ukraine, including the ongoing high-level discussions between Russia and the US. Our Embassy in Kyiv is also monitoring local developments. We call for a peaceful resolution of the situation through sustained diplomatic efforts for long-term peace and stability in the region and beyond.”\n\nMore than a week ago, on January 19, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman called up Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and the two discussed “Russia’s concerning military build-up on Ukraine’s borders”. However, New Delhi, which did not issue an official statement on the matter, choosing to closely monitor the developments before breaking its silence on Friday.\n\nWith key strategic partners on both sides, India cannot afford any hasty moves hurting its vital stakes. Sources said while there is concern about Russia’s “muscle-flexing” and external intervention in national matters, New Delhi does not want to jeopardise the close military ties with Moscow.\n\nAlmost 60 per cent of India’s military supplies are Russian manufactured, which means it cannot afford to alienate Moscow, particularly at a time when Indian and Chinese troops continue to be in a stand-off on the eastern border.\n\nAt the same time, the US and Europe, which are pushing back against Russia over Ukraine, are both important partners from India’s strategic calculus. Many American platforms have been used for reconnaissance and surveillance along the India-China border. Winter clothing for 50,000 troops has been sourced from these western strategic partners.\n\nIndia is also conscious that the hostility between the West and Russia, with talks of sanctions being considered, is likely to push Moscow in the direction of Beijing, hence strengthening the Chinese.\n\nAnother concern for Delhi is the small Indian community in Ukraine, comprising mostly students in medical colleges. The Indian Embassy in Kyiv has started collating information on the students as part of preparations for any hostilities. According to government estimates, 18,000 Indian students were in Ukraine in 2020, but the numbers may have dipped since due to Covid and classes moving online at many places.\n\nSources in the strategic establishment recall that when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and the West lined up against President Vladimir Putin, India had expressed “concern” but also qualified it by talking of “legitimate Russian interests”. The view was articulated at the time, under the UPA government, by then NSA Shiv Shankar Menon. In fact, Putin had thanked India for the “restrained and objective” stand, and called up PM Manmohan Singh to express gratitude.\n\nLast Updated 29 Jan'22",
